                            I have had the pleasure of engaging Darsh on a number of technical consulting projects. The spectrum of skills at Darsh's disposal means that he is an individual I know I can rely upon, regardless of the task, and somebody who can deal with ambiguity
                            in finding the right solution. I have been particularly impressed by Darsh's confidence and competence as a presenter, being at home in front of both technical and commercial audiences; his breadth of experience, from theoretical
                            astrophysics to AI and biotech, from academia to the startup world to consulting, providing a strong base for researching deeply technical topics; his inquisitive and amicable nature, proving of great use in primary research,
                            and; his first principles thinking allowing him to independently navigate complex problem solving tasks. It has been a great pleasure working with Darsh and I look forward to our next project together. </p>

                            Working with Darsh is a rewarding experience. He was an active participant on experiential learning consultancy programmes I lead at the University of Oxford Careers Service where I am Entrepreneur-in-Residence. Working collaboratively in a couple of
                            project teams, Darsh applied his research and strategy skills flexibly on two diverse projects: one was about the business opportunity for the supply chain application of AI and blockchain and the other on collaboration between
                            organisations locally to address climate change. The feedback from our clients at the end of the work was excellent. Darsh grasps new ideas quickly, works well with team colleagues and consistently established productive client
                            relationships on our programmes. He has strong leadership qualities and actively looks for ways to help others and give back. We are very grateful that after participating on our programmes, Darsh has sought out prospective
                            clients to help the Oxford Careers Service provide new learning opportunities for the students and researchers that will follow him. I wish Darsh every success and I’m looking forward to following his career journey.
